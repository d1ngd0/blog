Whoa, you came to the about page?! Little creepy to want to know so much about me no? Anyway, I am a Father (one daughter), husband (one wife) and Software Engineer at a major retailer. I work on an observability team, providing the tools and infrastructure necessary for other engineers to understand the health of their applications. I also get up at crazy early times to dive into topics of interest, write blog posts and do a bit of light reading. Also, never totally mastered proper spelling, and lean quite heavily on spell check. If you see any mistakes, grammar or otherwise, let me know and I'll fix it; maybe.
