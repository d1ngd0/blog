Whoa, you came to the about page?! Little creepy to want to know so much about me no? Anyway, I am a Father (one daughter), husband (one wife) and Software Engineer at a major retailer. I work on an observability team, providing the tools and infrastructure necessary for other engineers to understand the health of their applications. I also get up at crazy early or uncomfortably late times to dive into topics of interest, write blog posts and do a bit of light reading. Also, never totally mastered proper spelling, and lean quite heavily on spell check. If you see any mistakes, grammar or otherwise, let me know and I'll fix it; maybe.

During my day job I like to solve problems by automating them away. If something has to be done more than once I have a bash script in my `~/.bin/` directory, usually with some help text, to get it done quickly. In other words awk and the `|` have treated me well. If the problem is more complex I will create the tools needed (Often with Go, Rust or something else) to solve it in the most simple yet generic way. I love taking on big novel challenges that require creativity or those annoying problems that no one could quite figure out.

When I am not working I enjoy a plethora of circulating hobbies such as hiking, drumming, painting, drawing, photography, woodworking, cooking, barbecuing, running, writing and more software engineering. That isn't to say I am good at all these things, but I do enjoy them.
